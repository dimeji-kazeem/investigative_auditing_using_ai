# Investigative Auditing using Artificial Intelligence
**Leveraging Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Internal Auditing Practices: A Comprehensive Analysis of Investigative Results**

**Overview:** Providing impartial and unbiased audits of internal controls, risk management, and compliance procedures, internal auditing plays a crucial role in enterprises. Internal auditors confront difficulty in effectively and efficiently assessing massive amounts of data to discover risks and anomalies as the business environment grows more sophisticated and data-driven. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics have become powerful tools that have the potential to change the way internal auditing is done. These techniques provide improved capabilities for analysing massive datasets and gaining insightful information.

**Objectives:** The major purposes of this technical task are:
1. To analyse how data analytics and artificial intelligence approaches are used in internal auditing investigations
2. To analyze how data analytics and AI affect the efficacy, value, and efficiency of internal audits.
3. To determine trends, oddities, and conclusions based on the findings of your investigation.
4. Give practitioners and organizations advice on how to improve internal auditing procedures using automation.

Based on the objectives above, the code answer the following questions obtainable in an organization's enevironment, as relates internal auditior's job functions.
1.	How do experts in internal auditing employ data analytics and artificial intelligence in their investigations?
2.	What effects do data analytics and artificial intelligence have on internal auditing methods in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and value?
3.	What patterns, peculiarities, and insights can be gleaned from the outcomes of data analytics and artificial intelligence-based research?
4.	What suggestions can be made to practitioners and companies based on the findings to improve internal auditing practices?

**Approach:** Various data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches will be used to assess the investigative outcomes. The methods applied consist of:
1.	**Descriptive analytics:** To acquire insights into the distribution, patterns, and trends within the investigation data, descriptive statistics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis will be used.
2.	**Predictive Analytics:** To forecast results, spot abnormalities, and pinpoint possible problem areas, machine learning methods like classification or regression models will be employed.
3.	**Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining:** NLP techniques will be used to extract useful information from textual data, such as audit reports or practitioner notes, to detect common themes, sentiment analysis, or critical risk indicators.
4.	**Network Analysis:** Network analysis techniques can be used to comprehend the connections and interdependence among various audit areas, procedures, or entities in the data under investigation.
